# PBR.ONE
 
PBR.ONE is a set of HTML pages that can be embedded into any website to quickly and easily create interactive previews of PBR materials and HDRI environment maps right in the browser.
Resources can be loaded by simply adding URLs into the hashstring of the page and the page dynamically adjusts as the string changes to allow for interactive switching of environments or PBR maps.

Visit the [examples page](https://pbr.one/examples.html) to see several demos showing all of PBR.ONE's features.

Check the instructions for [Installation and Hosting](docs/InstallationAndHosting.md) on how to get started and the [Parameter Reference](docs/ParameterReference.md) for all possible views and parameters.
